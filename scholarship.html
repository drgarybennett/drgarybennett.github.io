  <h4>Research Overview: Digital Health, Obesity, and Primary Care</h4>

  <p>
    My research focuses on leveraging digital therapeutics to improve improving obesity prevention and treatment in the primary care setting, particularly those serving medically vulnerable patients. Traditional clinic-based approaches have struggled to deliver scalable, affordable, and efficacious treatment outcomes. My work addresses this gap by developing and testing technology-enabled interventions that are evidence-based, highly personalized, and designed for real-world clinical environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Across a series of randomized and pragmatic trials, I have demonstrated that fully automated and low-burden digital interventions can achieve high engagement and clinically meaningful outcomes in a range of high-risk patient populations.

    This work also extends beyond weight loss to include evidence-based approaches to weight gain prevention for patients who are not interested in losing weight but remain at high cardiometabolic risk

    More broadly, my scholarship has contributed to the field’s understanding of how digital health tools can be leveraged to reduce health disparities and improve population health outcomes

  <h4>Advancing Obesity Treatment</h4>

  <p>
    The inability to reliably produce clinically meaningful weight loss among those with the highest risk of obesity and its associated health conditions. Over the past decade, our work has made important strides in addressing this gap. Most of these studies have been conducted in primary care settings, where the burden of obesity-related disease is greatest and resources are often constrained.
  </p>

  <p>
    Across a series of randomized and pragmatic trials, we have demonstrated the feasibility of creating scalable, fully automated, and highly personalized intervention technologies. These approaches have achieved high levels of engagement and produced clinically meaningful outcomes.

  <h4>Building Evidence-Based Obesity Care in Primary Care Settings</h4>

  <p>
    Nationally, there are few low-cost, evidence-based obesity treatments available in primary care. Although provider-delivered lifestyle counseling can be effective, it occurs infrequently in routine practice. Structural barriers—including limited capacity and inadequate reimbursement—constrain the widespread availability of dietitian-led counseling services. As a result, uptake of evidence-based behavioral weight management interventions in primary care remains limited.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite the central role of primary care in obesity management, relatively few studies have examined the efficacy of behavioral weight management interventions in this setting. Through a series of efficacy and pragmatic effectiveness trials, we have demonstrated that primary care–based obesity treatments can be effective and scalable across a range of challenged care delivery environments.

  <h4>Expanding the Scope of Obesity Care Beyond Weight Loss</h4>

  <p>
    Comprehensive obesity care extends beyond weight loss alone. Up to half of patients with obesity report little or no interest in losing weight. For these individuals, clinical practice guidelines recommend a focus on preventing further weight gain. Until recently, evidence-based weight gain prevention interventions were largely unavailable in the primary care setting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our work provided the first evidence of efficacious weight gain prevention approaches designed specifically for primary care delivery.
