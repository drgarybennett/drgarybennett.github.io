<p>
Gary G. Bennett, Ph.D., serves as Dean of Trinity College of Arts & Sciences at Duke University, the institution’s largest and most comprehensive academic unit. Trinity encompasses 35 departments and programs across the arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences; educates nearly 6,000 undergraduates; and supports Duke’s largest doctoral student population. With more than 720 regular-rank faculty, approximately 1,600 graduate students, and an operating enterprise approaching half a billion dollars annually, Trinity functions as a complex research organization as much as an academic community—central to Duke’s educational mission and global standing.
</p>

<h5 class="mt-5">Academic and Enterprise Leadership</h5>

<p>
As dean, Dr. Bennett leads a large, research-intensive academic enterprise with responsibility for faculty excellence, financial stewardship, and long-term institutional strategy. Trinity plays a central role in Duke’s undergraduate education while sustaining the university’s largest doctoral programs across three academic divisions: Arts & Humanities, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences.
</p>

<p>
His leadership emphasizes aligning people, resources, and priorities to sustain academic excellence at scale—balancing faculty recruitment and retention, research investment, student access, and fiscal responsibility in a highly competitive environment.
</p>

<h5 class="mt-4">Institutional Leadership and Stewardship</h5>

<p>
In addition to academic leadership, Dr. Bennett stewards a large and complex operating enterprise, navigating constrained resources, managing institutional risk, and making long-term decisions that preserve academic strength. He works closely with university leadership, boards, donors, and external partners and has extensive experience communicating complex academic and financial issues to non-academic audiences.

<h5 class="mt-5">University-Wide Leadership</h5>

<p>
Prior to becoming dean, Dr. Bennett served as Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education at Duke University, where he provided strategic leadership for the undergraduate experience. He oversaw a 15-unit portfolio spanning advising, academic support, financial aid, study abroad, nationally competitive scholarships, and co-curricular programs.
</p>

<p>
During this period, Duke raised tens of millions of dollars to expand access and innovation in undergraduate education. Dr. Bennett led the development of DukeLIFE, supporting first-generation and low-income students, and QuadEx, Duke’s inclusive living-and-learning model integrating residential, social, and intellectual life.

<h5 class="mt-5">Research</h5>

<p>
Dr. Bennett is a nationally recognized scholar in digital health and behavioral medicine, with more than 200 scientific publications and continuous funding from the National Institutes of Health. Nearly two decades ago, he established one of the first digital health research programs, now internationally recognized for translating rigorous science into scalable, technology-enabled interventions deployed in real-world clinical settings.
</p>

<p>
His research has focused on designing practical, deployable solutions—particularly for medically vulnerable populations—demonstrating sustained impact at scale while advancing the science of behavior change.

<h5 class="mt-5">From Ideas to Impact: Strategy, Scale, and Execution</h5>

<p>
Dr. Bennett’s work extends beyond scholarship to building and leading mission-aligned enterprises that translate ideas into durable impact. He has co-founded three digital health ventures grounded in rigorous science and designed to operate at scale. Crimson Health Solutions, which developed digital disease management interventions, was acquired by Health Dialog in 2007. Scale Down, a digital obesity treatment company, was acquired by Anthem in 2017. He is also a co-founder of Coeus Health, a leading provider of health APIs supporting large-scale digital health infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
Across these efforts, Dr. Bennett has operated at the intersection of research, strategy, and execution—working with multidisciplinary teams, managing growth, navigating acquisition, and aligning mission with sustainability. This experience informs his approach to academic leadership, bringing discipline around strategy, execution, and long-term stewardship while remaining grounded in the core values of higher education.

<h5 class="mt-5">Education and Academic Formation</h5>

<p>
Dr. Bennett began his academic career on the faculty of the Harvard School of Public Health and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where he conducted research at the intersection of behavioral science and clinical care. He joined Duke University in 2009.
</p>

<p>
He earned a bachelor’s degree from Morehouse College, an AM and PhD in clinical health psychology from Duke University, completed a clinical internship in medical psychology at Duke University Medical Center, and was the Alonzo Yerby Postdoctoral Fellow in Social Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health.
