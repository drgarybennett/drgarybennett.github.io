<h5 class="mt-5">University-Wide Leadership</h5>

<p>
Prior to becoming dean, Dr. Bennett served as vice provost for undergraduate education, where he provided strategic vision and leadership for many facets of Duke’s undergraduate experience. He oversaw a 15-unit portfolio spanning advising, academic support, financial aid, study abroad, nationally competitive scholarships, and co-curricular programs.
</p>

<p>
Under Bennett’s leadership, Duke raised tens of millions of dollars to expand access and innovation in undergraduate education.

<h5 class="mt-5">From Ideas to Impact</h5>

<p>
Dr. Bennett’s work extends beyond scholarship to building and leading mission-aligned enterprises that translate ideas into durable impact. He has co-founded three digital health ventures grounded in rigorous science and designed to operate at scale. Crimson Health Solutions, which developed digital disease management interventions, was acquired by Health Dialog in 2007. Scale Down, a digital obesity treatment company, was acquired by Anthem in 2017. He is also a co-founder of Coeus Health, a leading provider of health APIs supporting large-scale digital health infrastructure. He has served as a science advisor and board member to several consumer electronic and digital health companies, including Apple, Google, Weight Watchers, Wondr Health, and Lore.  
</p>

<p>
Across these efforts, Dr. Bennett has served as a senior leader, helping to scale organizations with responsibility for strategy, budgets, and execution. He has led multidisciplinary teams, managed growth, and helped guide organizations through acquisition while maintaining mission alignment and financial sustainability. He brings this operating experience into academic leadership, applying management discipline and long-term stewardship in service of higher education’s core mission.
